Several related inference processes designed to test composite hypotheses about the combined effect of several covariates over an entire range of conditional quantile functions are also formulated. The asymptotic behavior of the inference processes is shown to be closely related to earlier p-sample goodness-of-fit theory involving Bessel processes. The approach is illustrated with some hypothetical examples, an application to recent empirical models of international economic growth, and some Monte Carlo evidence.},

     abstract = {The 1980's witnessed rapid changes in the structure of wages in the United States. In this study, recently developed techniques for quantile regression are applied to every March Current Population Survey since 1964 and changes in the return to schooling and experience at different points of the wage distribution are examined. The quantile regression technique parsimoniously describes the entire conditional wage distribution. This conditional distribution is used to examine changes in within-group wage inequality as measured by the difference between conditional quantiles. Two linear models are considered: a simple one-group model, and a 16-group model. The results suggest that the returns to schooling and experience differ across quantiles of the wage distribution but their patterns of change are similar. Significant differences in wage inequality are also found across the various skill groups. The paper also presents a new imputation method for CPS data.},

     abstract = {A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term "regression quantiles." The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},
